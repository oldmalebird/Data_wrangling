    "清洗这个项目的数据时要牢记几个要点：\n",
    "- 我们只需要含有图片的原始评级 (不包括转发)。尽管数据集中有 5000 多条数据，但是并不是所有都是狗狗评分，并且其中有一些是转发。\n",
    "- 完整地评估和清理整个数据集将需要大量时间，实践和展示数据处理技巧没有必要将这个数据集全部清理。因此，本项目的要求只是评估和清理此数据集中的至少 8 个质量问题和至少 2 个整洁度问题。\n",
    "- 根据 整洁数据 tidy data 的规则要求，本项目的数据清理应该包括将三个数据片段进行合并。\n",
    "- 如果分子评级超过分母评级，不需要进行清洗。这个 特殊评分系统 是 WeRateDogs 人气度较高的主要原因。（同样，也不需要删除分子小于分母的数据）\n",
    "- 不必收集 2017 年 8 月 1 日之后的数据，你可以收集到这些推特的基本信息，但是你不能收集到这些推特对应的图像预测数据，因为你没有图像预测算法的使用权限。"

    "  - 评估数据：收集上述三个数据集之后，使用目测评估和编程评估的方式，对数据进行质量和清洁度的评估。在你的 wrangle_act.ipynb Jupyter Notebook 中记录评估过程和结果，最终列出至少 8 个质量问题 和 2 个清洁度问题。要符合项目规范，必须对项目动机中的要求进行评估（参见上一页课程的 关键要点 标题）。\n",
    "  - 清洗数据：对你在评估时列出的每个问题进行清洗。在 wrangle_act.ipynb 展示清洗的过程。结果应该为一个优质干净整洁的主数据集（pandas DataFrame 类型） （如果都是以推特 ID 为观察对象的一些特征列，则清理最终只能有一个主数据集，如果有其他观察对象及其对应的特征字段，可以创建其他的数据集，同样需要清理）。同样地，必须符合项目动机的要点要求。\n",
    "- 对清洗过的数据进行储存、分析和可视化：将清理后的数据集存储到 CSV 文件中，命名为 twitter_archive_master.csv。如果有其他观察对象的数据集存在，需要多个表格，那么要给这些文件合理命名。另外，你也可以把清洗后的数据存储在 SQLite 数据库中（如果这样存储的话，该数据库文件也需要提交）。在 wrangle_act.ipynb Jupyter Notebook 中对清洗后的数据进行分析和可视化。必须生成至少 3 个见解和 1 个可视化。\n",
    "- 书面报告 1) 你的数据整理工作 和 2) 你的数据分析和可视化：创建一个 300-600 字的书面报告，命名为 wrangle_report.pdf，在该报告中简要描述你的数据整理过程。这份报告可以看作是一份内部文档，供你的团队成员查看交流。创建一个 250 字以上的书面报告，命名为 act_report.pdf，在该报告中，你可以与读者交流观点，展示你使用整理过的数据生成的可视化图表。这份报告可以看作是一份外部文档，如博客帖子或杂志文章。"
